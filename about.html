  Hello! My name is Naila and I am a professional and technical writing who is passionate about writing. In my spare time, you can find  me reading, PC gaming, or planning my next travel adventure.  I believe that every experience is an opportunity to learn something new and I'm always eager to broaden my horizons and try new things. Thanks for taking the time to get to know a little bit about me!
