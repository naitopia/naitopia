<p>Almond by Won-Pyung Sohn is a poignant and powerful novel that explores themes of disability, identity, and acceptance. The story follows Yunjae, a young boy with a neurological condition that prevents him from feeling pain, as he navigates the challenges of growing up and discovering who he truly is. Pyung's prose is both lyrical and heartfelt, and she does an excellent job of creating complex and sympathetic characters. Almond is a deeply moving and thought-provoking book that will stay with readers long after they've finished reading it.</p>
